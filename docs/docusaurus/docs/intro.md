# Zappy - Multi-Agent Virtual Ecosystem

Welcome to the **Zappy** documentation, a sophisticated multi-agent virtual ecosystem featuring a game server, 3D graphical interface, and intelligent AI clients.

## What is Zappy?

Zappy is an advanced multiplayer simulation where AI-controlled agents compete for survival and evolution in a resource-constrained virtual world. Players must collect resources, communicate with teammates, and perform complex rituals to advance through difficulty levels.

### Game Mechanics

- **Resource Management**: Agents must collect food to survive and minerals for evolution
- **Team Collaboration**: Players work together to perform incantation rituals
- **Strategic Communication**: Encrypted broadcast system for team coordination
- **Spatial Intelligence**: Dynamic pathfinding and exploration algorithms
- **Level Progression**: Eight levels of increasing complexity and requirements

## System Architecture

The project consists of three main components communicating via TCP/IP protocols:

### ðŸŽ® Game Server (C)
High-performance game engine managing:
- Real-time world simulation
- Multi-client networking
- Game rules enforcement
- Resource distribution algorithms

### ðŸŽ¨ 3D Graphical Interface (C++)
Advanced visualization system featuring:
- Real-time 3D rendering with Raylib
- Dynamic camera controls
- Resource and player visualization
- Game state monitoring tools

### ðŸ¤– AI Clients (Python)
Intelligent agents with:
- Behavioral state machines
- A* pathfinding algorithms
- Encrypted team communication
- Adaptive decision-making systems
